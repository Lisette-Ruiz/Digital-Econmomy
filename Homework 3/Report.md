## RESUME
New revolution is coming, and that refers mainly to the technology part. One clear difference between the digital revolution and the steam and electricity revolutions is the speed at which the technology is being diffused across countries. On this resume, it is pretending to discuss about some important spects that have impated in our society nowadays.

### Describe the public acceptance of the technology.
- Today we live in a reality where technology has become part of our daily life. It is important to mention that this comes from a simple tool that makes it easier for us to do some work such as a cell phone to smart cities that are in the very near future. Humanity has adapted quite well because each existing technological tool makes it easier for us to do our activities more easily compared to before.For example, before to access study books it was necessary to go to a library, now, with the use of From an electronic device and internet access, it is possible to obtain different types of information from different sources apart from digital books, stories such as articles, blogs, courses, games, videos, among others. Nowadays children are born with the opportunity to have a device in hand, however, we must emphasize that this type of technology can be as advantageous as mentioned previously, as well as harmful; delaying the child's learning, curiosity and even her social life by the simple fact that she is raised with an electronic device for most of her life and without objective supervision. So, the acceptance of technology is taken for granted, however there has been a lack of control when using these new tools in something non-productive for children who will soon be the adults of this century.Some of the newest technologies today and that have supported us in our daily lives are social networks: Facebook, Twitter or Skype which allow us to interact with people in a visual society. Messaging applications, such as SMS, whatsapp, telegram, which allow us to share files, photos, videos at the moment through the internet. Smart Watches - We can now send messages via tablets, voice assistants, smart watches, and more. 

### Describe the impact of social networks on information and communication tech (ICT) .
- First of all, communication is essential to understand ourselves as a society. Before the existence of the internet, communication was more complicated to share because it was through letters that had to travel for hours and even days to be received by the receiver and in the same way it happened when responding to a message. But now everything has become easier due to the Internet and technologies that allow communication to occur within seconds, such as a simple WhatsApp through a mobile device, an email or even a news spread through the networks. most popular social networks. The impact we have had is that all information shared through the internet can be seen anywhere in the world with the help of an electronic device, this benefits and affects in a great way, because as well as we can alert ourselves to any global problem in question. minutes, so you can disclose personal information that puts third parties involved at risk or you can even enrich yourself with false information. Much of the easiest information to share worldwide is through social networks such as Faebook, Tweeter and even Instagram, which you have to be very aware of and make sure that the information is true and not just falsified information. 

### Identify skills for the use of ICT in work and life. 
- Currently, ICT skills are basic for having a competent professional life, that is, learning to manage electronic devices such as computers and cell phones, managing programs in software such as Microsoft, communicating with people through the internet, are some of the the skills that today are developing and being part of us since we are in elementary schools. However, there are a few other implicit ones that will help us to work professionally as well as in the personal sphere, these could be: 1) the processing and presentation of the most relevant information: this is what we mean by knowing how to extract the most important information from any topic , translate it into some work with the help of a virtual tool and likewise, present this information with an objective approach. 2) The use of daily applications where important information is presented, such as word (for the creation of documents), excel (for the creation of calculation tables), porwerpoint (for presentations or exhibitions), you must know how take care of your device from viruses, such as ordering it so that the files are simply easy to find, etc. 3) Oral expression will allow us to define with more precision what is the best way to express ourselves to convey the message, as well as to identify in which tools it is more convenient to support ourselves to transmit the information objectively. 

### Describe the existing regulation in Employment, Ethics, politics and the data science related regulation.
- This issue of politics, ethics should be taken seriously because it is a sensitive issue. Data protection is better known as protecting the security, integrity, and availability of important information data. While we know that there are data that can be found publicly, while others are completely private and only certain people have access to. A scientist or data engineer requires the use of data to be able to carry out the analysis for their subsequent objective project, however beforehand they must consider the ethics-privacy standards for the ethical use of these that involve sensitive information about some group of people, companies , documents, among others, because it is very likely that we can get into legal problems due to the immoral use of the data, whether consciously or by mistake. This type of data allows us to access a vulnerable part of the respective data to be processed, that is why by not complying with the defined and probably signed norms, it is possible to end up under a legal problem that puts our reputation or even freedom at risk. It is important to remember that social networks have a great impact on society today, therefore, we must be careful of the pages we access, the publications we make and even the actions we do because it can affect a third and if so, you will not need a judicial branch to investigate you, but with the power of social networks they can share the information-crime-misunderstanding and expose you in a degrading way. (It is worth mentioning that this new movement in social networks has helped a lot by doing justice in cases that the authorities ignore, however, the other side of the coin is that false information can be shared that can have fatal results such as misunderstandings and exhibition of your privacy itself). 
 
 ### Describe security strategies and their regulation. 

- There are various types of security depending on the individual to be treated. For example, for personal data, all those illegal processes that may misuse them by accessing, forwarding or transferring them to unauthorized personnel, deleting, modifying or altering identification data, among other things, are taken into account. The same happens with data of companies or businesses that allow access to personnel, these must comply with a series of privacy regulations to avoid legal problems that put both the person in charge and those involved in the crime of privacy at risk.

- In 2016 a new protection standard was adopted, this was called "General Data Protection Regulation", these standards are interesting because a formal association such as GDPR The penalty for non-compliance is a fine of up to € 20,000,000 or four percent of the global revenues of an organization. It is worth mentioning that some of the strategies carried out to ensure that these types of regulations are complied with is a penalty for non-compliance is a fine of up to € 20,000,000 or four percent of the global revenues of an organization.

- Although, there are various strategies that allow supporting the protection of data, such as: Data Backup (allows us to have a backup in case of losing information due to some carelessness or some malicious act that eliminated the system), Firewalls (help you monitor network traffic so you can detect and block malware), Data erasure (deleting sensitive data once it has been processed to reduce the risk of exposure), Encryption (converts the data into a non-readable format so that only an encryption key can convert it back to simple text), among others. 

### Identify the regulatory framework and institutions that affect the digital economy.
- Before starting it is important to mention that market changes are the main indicator for regulation to be reduced or eliminated completely. Technological innovations are becoming ever more embedded in our day-to-day lives, generating valuable new opportunities but also digital risks that are increasing exponentially. Now, to begin by understanding the context, we must define what the regulatory frameworks are; These refer to the division of power distributed in the institutions involved, be they norms, rules, implementation strategies, among others. It is worth mentioning that there is normal physical commerce, which we know every day, and now with Amazon, Shein and among other companies they are implementing digital commerce, that is, paying for the product-service through digital payments such as Pay Pal, to Through blockchain or some exchanges that are carried out, on the other hand, it is worth mentioning that there are frameworks that seek to benefit this type of digital thing through the security of your data. To be effective, governments have to redesign the way they regulate the world’s rapidly growing digital economy, taking into account four new, parallel, emerging digital challenges: Scope; Scale; Digital products and digital behavior.
